# rsa
  This repo shows implementation of the RSA public-key cryptographic system. Plain RSA and a version with a SHA256 digest are provided.
## Experiments
  There are three experiments consisting of attacks on the RSA:
- no message attack
- attack with two two messages m1 and m2 so that m = m1 * m2 mod N
- attack with weak value of e = 3 http://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/abstracts/RSAattack-survey.html z
